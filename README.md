# telnyxNextcloud
This is a plugin to integrate texting and calling with telnyx service.

## Idea behind this
In my company I use Telnix quite frequently and there are no really good solutions for texting with a Telnyx phone number.
I am aware of one project that is currently providing this service but I think a Nextcloud application would be much better.

## Features
1. Recieving and sending text 
2. recieving and sending calls
3. mobile application to be hosted on F-Droid
